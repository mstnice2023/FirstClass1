    <p>The name of my nation is Bangladesh. Its location in eastern South Asia borders the Bay of Bengal in the south, India, Myanmar, and simply India to the east and west. Its total area, including waterways, is 147,570 square kilometers. It won its freedom following a bloody liberation conflict. Three million men and women have sacrificed their lives for independence. The newly formed country faced many hurdles and harsh times after gaining independence. It does, however, rise well. Today, Bangladesh ranks among the best countries in South Asia to live in. In our country, there are many breathtaking locations to visit. Bangladesh is a small country. But it has a sizable population. About 120 million individuals call this little nation home. The population density in this area is high. Approximately 800 people call a square kilometer home. Bangladesh is primarily agricultural, with farmers making up most of the population. It is still a charming and serene country, though. Bangladeshis are extraordinarily kind to one another. With its luscious green environment and abundant trees and flowers, it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. The world's longest sea beach is Cox's Bazaar. One of the most extensive mangrove forests in the world and a fantastic source of beauty is the Sundarban. The Royal Bengal Tiger might be found there. I have a deep passion for my country. That I was born here is a blessing.</p>

     <p>From its founding in 1949, the Awami League was the expression of Bengali nationalism in the territory then known as East Pakistan. Following elections in December 1970, which the league won, the military ruler of Pakistan canceled the National Assembly. Opposition to this by the Awami League led to the creation of a national flag for the Bengali homeland, Bangladesh. The flag of Bangladesh, like that of Pakistan, is dark green. This is a symbol of the Islamic faith of most of the population. Bengalis officially have a secular state, however, and therefore have defined the green as a symbol of the rich vegetation of their country and of the hope placed in their youth.<abbr title="The national flag of Bangladesh was adopted officially on 17 January 1972. It consists of a red circle on top of a dark green banner. The red circle is offset slightly toward the hoist so that it appears centered when the flag is flying.

The silhouette map of the land was eliminated, and the red disk was shifted slightly off-centre toward the hoist. The symbolism of the red was defined as the blood shed by Bengalis in their fight for independence. The disk was said to be a symbol of “the rising sun of a new country.”
